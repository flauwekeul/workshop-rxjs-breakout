## Getting started

```
git clone git@github.com:flauwekeul/workshop-rxjs-breakout.git
cd workshop-rxjs-breakout
npm install
```

1. Clone the project from GitHub: https://github.com/flauwekeul/workshop-rxjs-breakout
2. `cd` into the folder
3. Install dependencies
4. Open your favorite editor

## Development

This project uses [Snowpack](https://www.snowpack.dev/). Run `npm start` to start a dev server and `http://localhost:8080/` will be opened automatically. You can use types, settings and utils from the `shared` folder. Take care not to import from the `finished` folder as that would make this workshop too easy 😉.

# Finished result

With the dev server running, go to [http://localhost:8080/finished/](http://localhost:8080/finished/) (**including the trailing slash** unfortunately) to see what you'll be making.
